in the sky, Dr. Harper decided to test his invention. He programmed the

lively marketplace filled with people dressed in vibrant clothing. He

realized he had to return to his time. Torn between his love for 
Isabella and his responsibility to his own time, he faced a difficult 
choice. Should he stay and embrace a new life with her, or return to his
 own era and continue his work? In the end, he chose to return home, 
believing that the future held endless possibilities. With a heavy 
heart, he activated the time machine and stepped back into the familiar 
chaos of the present day. However, as he arrived back in his lab, he 
discovered that time had changed. His invention had altered the 
timeline, and Isabella was now a renowned artist in his time, her works 
celebrated worldwide. Dr. Harper smiled, knowing that their paths would 
cross again, and perhaps this time, he could find a way to be with her.'</li>
